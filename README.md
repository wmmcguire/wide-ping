# wide-ping

## Background

</br> My first PowerShell script. 
 
</br> Scenario: My boss had me access some home printers via IP. Since some not responsive by browser, I should also ping in order to see if the printer is reachable. 

</br> Did this manually in this scenario, though should a similar situation occur, I would
like to do this in a quicker fashion using PS.

</br> This script takes a list of hosts in a given single-line .csv file and pings them.
